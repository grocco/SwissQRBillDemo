  title: "Swiss QR Bill API"
  description: |
    The Swiss QR Bill API for generating the new payment slip for invoices. The QR code contains
    the complete payment information in a machine-readable form:

    - Payment amount and currency
    - Creditor address and account
    - Reference number issued by the creditor
    - Additional informationn for the recipient of the invoice
    - Debtor address
    - Alternative payment scheme instructions (future use)

    Debtor and amount can be omitted and filled in by the payer.

    The QR bill can be generated at the bottom of an A4 sheet or on it's own sheet (210 x 105mm). Alternatively,
    only the QR code can be generated. Supported formats are SVG or PDF.

    To successfully validate the bill data and generate a QR bill, the following main requirements must be met:

    - A valid address must at least contain *name*, *postal code*, *town* and *country ISO code*.
    - The creditor address and accout number are mandatory.
    - The debtor addresses is optional. If is not used, it must be omitted entirely
      or all address fields must be *null* or empty.
    - The account number must be a valid IBAN of Switzerland or Liechtenstein.
    - If a reference number is provided, it must be either a valid QR/ISR reference number
      or a valid ISO 11649 creditor reference (i.e. the applicable check digits must be valid)
    - The currency must be either *CHF* or *EUR*.

    If fields are too long, they are automaticalluy truncated. If characters outside the restricted range of
    characters are used, they are automatically replaced. The validation result contains warnings about
    truncations and replacements.
